            <p>Software testing is the process of identifying and fixing errors, flaws, or inaccuracies in computer software. It is a crucial aspect of software development and quality assurance. Software testing can be done manually, using testing tools, or automated using test cases.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software testing can be divided into different types, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software testing methodologies:
        </h1><br>
        <p>
           1] Unit testing focuses on testing individual units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, to ensure that they work correctly and meet the specified requirements. Integration testing involves testing the interactions between different units of code, such as modules, to ensure that they work together correctly and produce the expected results.
        </p><br>

        <p>
          2] System testing focuses on testing the entire system, including its components, to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Acceptance testing involves testing the system to ensure that it meets the business requirements and user acceptance criteria, and that it provides the desired functionality and usability.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            3] Regression testing involves retesting the system after making changes to ensure that the existing functionality and bug fixes are not affected.
        </p><br>

        <p>
          4]  Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are techniques that automate the integration and deployment of software changes, ensuring that the system is always in a working state and meets the specified requirements.
